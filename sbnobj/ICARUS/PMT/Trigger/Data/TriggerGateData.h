/**
 * @brief Logical multi-level gate.
 * @tparam Tick type used to count the ticks
 * @tparam TickInterval type used to quantify tick difference
 * 
 * A `TriggerGate` object tracks a logical multi-level gate, that is a gate
 * whose level can be not only `0` or `1`, but an arbitrary integral number.
 * The gate level is defined as a positive number. The general convention is
 * that a level of `0` means the gate is closed, while any other level
 * (typically `1`) means it's open. In a multi-level gate, one can choose to
 * interpret the gate as open only if it reaches a chosen level higher than `1`.
 * The time domain of the gate is measured in ticks, which in this context are
 * @ref DetectorClocksIntroClocks "optical detector clock ticks" defined on
 * the @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsTime "electronics time scale".
 * That means that tick #0 is set
 * @ref DetectorClocksElectronicsStartTime "at the origin of that time scale".
 * The gate is unlimited, i.e. it can accommodate changes on any time tick
 * from #0 on (up to the machine limitations, `MaxTick`). For practical
 * purposes, `lastTick()` is instrumental to find the tick of the last gate
 * change.
 * 
 * Internally, the gate is represented by "events". The first event, at tick
 * #0, sets the level of the gate to the lowest possible (`0`, _closed_).
 * Each event may change the level at a given tick and all the following ones
 * until `MaxTick`. An actual gate is therefore defined by two events, an
 * opening event (that is an increase in level) and a closing one (a shift of
 * the same amount in the opposite direction).
